IoT-enabled 6-axis robotic arm controlled by an ESP8266 microcontroller. It uses MG996R servo motors for movement and features wireless control via a web interface or mobile app. The arm can be operated over WiFi for real-time joint control, pre-programmed sequences, and inverse kinematics, making it suitable for education, prototyping, and light automation tasks
